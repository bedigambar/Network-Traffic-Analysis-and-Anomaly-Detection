## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing network traffic and detecting anomalies using machine learning techniques.

Network traffic analysis is essential for understanding the behavior of devices in a network, identifying suspicious activities, and protecting against security threats. Anomaly detection helps in finding unusual patterns or outliers that may indicate security breaches, malware infections, or network misconfigurations.
